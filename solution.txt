Solution to "The Cabin"

• There are letters on multiple objects in the room that spells "fire". Push the button hidden in the fireplace.

• A hidden stach opens behind the painting. Grab the chest and put it on the table.

• Grab the battery on the fireplace.

• Put it in the radio on the table. A man will start to communicate a numeric code. 

• On the back wall, arrange the numbered pages in the same order as announced on the radio.

• When the code is correct (5-2-4), a key falls near the fireplace. 

• Grab the key and open the chest you previously put on the table.

• Take the door key inside the chest and escape the cabin.


Note
You can't grab an object when you are already holding somthing, but you can drop them in designated dropzone. These are identifiable thanks to their darker color and shape.
