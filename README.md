# The Cabin

---

### A web vr escape room

As you slowly regain consciousness, you realize that you are lying on a cold, hard floor in a small log cabin. You sit up, trying to get your bearings, but everything seems hazy and unfamiliar. You start to feel uneasy, sensing that you're not alone.

You find a flashlight on the ground and start to search the room as a means to escape.

(Touch to interact, interactions don't work in flat 3D)
